# CLRP-TG43v2-low-energy-seeds
This repository contains geometries model files for 40 low-energy brachytherapy seeds described and benchmarked in the CLRP TG-43 dosimetry parameter database using the open source Monte Carlo code egs_brachy application EGSnrc. The CLRP-TG43v2 database is hosted at Carleton University website (https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/egs_brachy/seed_database_v2) with a DOI at http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/tg43v2.
